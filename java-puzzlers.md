# Java Puzzlers

## Chapter 6: class puzzles

### General

ordering is important!  A lot of these problems have a general theme that the ordering of variable declaration etc can cause issues.

### Problem 49

- static fields get initialized with their default value first
- ordering is important

### Problem 50: instanceof, casting

- instanceof returns false if the left operand is null
- instanceof only works to check if the left operand is a sub-type of the right operand. If the types of A and B are completely unrelated, a compile-time error will occur. ([JLS 15.20.2, 15.16, 5.5)
- casting is telling the compiler **i know better than you**

### Problem 53 : The private constructor 'capture' pattern

This won't compile:

```java
public class MyThing extends Thing {
  private final int arg;
  public MyThing() {
    super(arg = SomeOtherClass.func()); 
  }
}
```
due to:

```java
MyThing.java:
canâ€™t reference arg before supertype constructor has been called
super(arg = SomeOtherClass.func());
```

Use it when -during construction -  you want to store the result of a calculation in a final field in a subclass, while also providing the field as a parameter to the super constructor call:


```java
public class MyThing extends Thing {
  private final int arg;
  public MyThing() {
    this(SomeOtherClass.func()); // delegation to private 'helper' constructor
  }
  private MyThing(int i) {  // calculation is captured as constructor param
    super(i); // Call to super-constructor
    arg = i; // field is initialized
  }
}
```

### Problem 54 : casting and static methods: value is not important!

Consider:

```java
public class Null {
  public static String greet() {
    return "hello!";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println(((Null) null).greet());
}
}
```

It prints out "Hello!" for the static method because:

>A qualifying expression for a static method invocation is evaluated, but its value is
ignored. There is no requirement that the value be non-null

Do NOT use expressions to invoke static methods, instead, one could have done:

```java
Null.greet();
```

### Problem 55: local variable declaration statements and for loops not in a 'block' : a bad combination


```java

  public class Creator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        Creature creature = new Creature();
      System.out.println(Creature.numCreated());
    }
  }

  class Creature {
    private static long numCreated = 0;

    public Creature() {
      numCreated++;
    }

    public static long numCreated() {
      return numCreated;
    }
  }
```

Will not work because local variable declarations must be **directly in a block**

A block being defined as

>A block is a pair
of curly braces and the statements and declarations contained within it

As we can see, the for loop here is not contained in a block.


```java

  public class Creator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        Creature creature = new Creature();
      }
      System.out.println(Creature.numCreated());
    }
  }

  class Creature {
    private static long numCreated = 0;

    public Creature() {
      numCreated++;
    }

    public static long numCreated() {
      return numCreated;
    }
  }
```

will do the trick.

## Chapter 7:  library puzzles

### Problem 57: Always override hashCode when overriding equals!

```java
  public class Name {
    private final String first, last;

    public Name(String first, String last) {
      this.first = first;
      this.last = last;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (!(o instanceof Name))
        return false;
      Name n = (Name) o;
      return n.first.equals(first) && n.last.equals(last);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Set<Name> s = new HashSet<Name>();
      s.add(new Name("Mickey", "Mouse"));
      System.out.println(
              s.contains(new Name("Mickey", "Mouse")));
    }
  }
```

Will print false because the hashCode was not overriden. the hashCode contract demands
that equal objects have equal hash codes.

What hashcode is used then if we are not providing it ourself?

>Because it fails to override hashCode, the Name class inherits its hashCode
implementation from Object. This implementation returns an identity-based hash
code. In other words, distinct objects are likely to have unequal hash values, even
if they are equal. Name does not fulfill the hashCode contract, so the behavior of a
hash set containing Name elements is unspecified.

Fix it by declaring:

```java
public int hashCode() {
  return 37 * first.hashCode() + last.hashCode();
}
```

or calling:

```java
Objects.hash(first,last);
```


Alternatively, use **records** for data-carriers.
